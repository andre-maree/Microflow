# Microflow
Welcome to Microflow.

# Overview
Microflow is a dynamic servlerless workflow orchestration engine built with Azure Durable Functions. Microflow separates the workflow design from the function code so that workflows are no longer hard-coded as with normal Durable Functions. The workflow can be designed outside of Microflow and then passed in as JSON for execution, so no code changes or deployments are needed to modify any aspect of a workflow. Microflow can be deployed to the Azure Functions Consumption or Premium plans, to an Azure App Service, or to Kubernetes.
